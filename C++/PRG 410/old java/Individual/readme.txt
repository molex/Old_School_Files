I used Eclipse to create this program. I pre-set all values to 0, this way if the claculate button is clicked and there is a missing value, it will treat it as 0. I am not happy with the way the program acts when you try to enter numbers. I tried it without initilizing all values to 0 and data entry was easier. It is a tradeoff between robustness and ease of use. I chose robustness.
