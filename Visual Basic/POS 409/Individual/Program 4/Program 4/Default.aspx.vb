'Description:           Write the program in VB.Net with a graphical user interface. Make the program Web based. Allow
'                       the user to select which way they want to calculate the mortgage: By input of the amount of the
'                       mortgage, the term of the mortgage and the interest rate of the mortgage
'                       or
'                       By input of the amount of the mortgage and then select from a menu of mortgage loans:
'                       - 7 years at 5.35%
'                       - 15 years at 5.5%
'                       - 30 years at 5.75%
'                       In either case, display the mortgage payment amount. Then, list the loan balance and interest paid
'                       for each payment over the term of the loan. Add graphics in the form of a chart. Allow the user to
'                       loop back and enter a new amount and make a new selection, or quit. Load the interest rates for the
'                       7 year, 15 year, and 30 year loans from a file. Insert comments to document the program.

'Release Notes:         This is version # 4.0 of this program. In this version, the program is now an ASP.Net Web Form. Added a graph as well
'                       The Graph shows the pricipal amount remaining over the course of the loan. Additionaly, I apologize for the way
'                       that this program looks. Had a lot of trouble getting the input validation working and the graph was hard too!
