\par \pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f0\fs20 This program allows you to enter a Title of a Movie and the Adjusted Total Box Office Amount into the  appropriate text boxes. After you have entered the information, you can either click the "Add" button or hit the enter key. This will store your title and Total Box Office.

\par The Sort by Box Office Button will sort all the information you have entered by total box office amount, from lowest to highest.
\par 
\par The Clear button will empty all of the information that you have entered and it will also clear the text box and the Top Grossing titles list.

\par The Easy Button will pre-load all of the James Bond Movie titles and their Adjusted total box Office revenues for you. They will all be displayed in the text box and you will be able to sort them.

For Example, If you use the "Easy Button", it will load 22 James Bond Movies. The Top 30% of 22 movies is 7 movies (rounded up). The list will display the 7 top grossing Bond movies in order from highest to lowest.
