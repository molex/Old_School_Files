</ul>
<p><br />

<p>OUR PRIVACY POLICY</p>

<p>CONTACTS FROM US</p>
<p>We also use our Customer List for our own follow-up contacts with you. Many of our customers look forward to being contacted by Doodle Coffee by mail to be kept up-to-date about new coffees and services, programs and benefits. We also maintain a number of e-mail mailboxes in an effort to support our online customers as effectively as we do on the phone or through the mail. We read every email that we receive and do our best to respond within 48 hours, if a response is required. We save a very limited number of e-mail messages, but only until the issue is resolved. We do not record email addresses, unless you have voluntarily provided it to us in your online customer service registration. If you did provide us with your e-mail address, we may notify you from time to time about Doodle Coffee products or services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive these e-mail notifications, please contact us at sales@doodlecoffee.com as we said before we do <em>not</em> trade, sell or disclose e-mail addresses with other companies.</p>

<p>COOKIES</p>
<p>Like most companies, we use &quot;cookies&quot; (small pieces of information stored on your computer) on certain parts of our web site. The cookie allows us to track your session, particularly when you are shopping in the Doodle Coffee catalog. This is necessary to ensure that we keep your order together while you browse through the catalog and select items for purchase. We do not use the cookie to collect any type of personal information, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your computer. Once again, we will <strong>Never</strong> sell your personal information to <strong>Anyone!!!</strong></p>

<p>SECURITY ONLINE</p>
<p>Most of our forms, especially when ordering a product or using online customer service, use secure pages to insure that the information sent between your computer and our system is secure. This is especially true if we are asking you for payment information.</p>
<p>We use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption method on all secure submissions. This method is generally accepted to insure that the transmission of personal information, such as account numbers and credit card information is secure. The most common browsers, Netscape and Internet Explorer, make it very obvious when information is being passed in a secure manner by showing either a completed key or a closed lock on the screen (Internet Explorer users will find the lock located just to the right of the Address Bar).</p>
