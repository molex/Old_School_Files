<h1>Introduction and Background</h1>

<p>This is going to be the Home Page for WWW.M1CR0SUX0R.COM. I have decided that I will use this opportunity to create a website about the Linux and Open Source Community. I have already purchased the Domain Name and this is something that I have though about doing for some time. I think that this class creates a perfect opportuinty to create the site.</p>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>The plan is to create a site that is devoted to helping people make the switch from Windows to Linux. The site will have a second page that conatins links to, and reviews of, different versions of Linux. There will also be a Blog and perhaps later a forum where users can discuss thier favorite Linux Distributions and help each other with problems they are experiancing with Linux.</p>

<h2>Further Explination</h2>

<p>As we continue to go through this course, I will make changes to this site and start to populate it with actual content and replacing this home page with the actual homepage. I have already placed an under construction page on the web. When we have finished this class and when I am satisfied with the resulting web page, I will change the under construction page to the one 's from this class. If you would like to see the under construction page, you can find it  here:<a href="http://www.M1CR0SUX0R.com"> www.M1CR0SUX0R.com</a></p>
