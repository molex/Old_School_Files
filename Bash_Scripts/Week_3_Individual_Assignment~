echo   Here are my answers to the 3 questions you asked. 
echo   1. What is the purpose of the echo command?
echo   The purpose of the echo command is to write a statement to the screen for the user.
echo
echo   2. In the case statement why are the first letters both caps and lower case?
echo   The letters are both capital and lowercase and inside of a bracket because this is a type of
echo   pattern matching or regular expression that is used in programs. 
echo   This way the answer will be excepted if the user enters the first 
echo   letter as a capital or lowercase. Otherwise the only accepted answer would be capital.
echo   This saves on confusion for the user.
echo
echo   3. What does esac mean? 
echo   ESAC is CASE backwards. It signifies to the program that the case statement is finished.
